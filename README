Core files:

```
analytical_models
|   gde_co.py # Contains the system setup and solver for the gas diffusion electrode from paper doi:10.1016/j.electacta.2021.138987
```

Other files / jupyter notebooks are there from model development and testing (e.g. `analytical_solution.ipynb`), as well as doing specific calculations (e.g. `ubc_modelling.ipynb`).

There is `pyproject.toml` which can be used to install the core files as python package by running
```
pip install -e .
``` 
Then it can be imported from any location e.g.
```
from analytical_models.gde_co import InputParameters, System, solve, solve_current
```
